            <br>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the foundation of privacy law in the US and worldwide. They outline crucial principles for data protection.
            <br><br>
            In line with these principles, we will take the following actions if a data breach occurs:
            <br>
            - We will notify affected users via email within 7 business days.
            <br><br>
            We also adhere to the Individual Redress Principle, which grants individuals the right to legally pursue data processors who fail to comply with privacy laws. This principle ensures recourse through courts or government agencies for non-compliance.
            <br><br>
